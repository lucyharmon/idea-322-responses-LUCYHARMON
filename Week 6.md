Where We Live: A museum that recreates rooms that have served and shaped artists. Bedrooms, best friend's living rooms, classrooms, studios. Immersive exhibits like these have always been my favorite parts of museums, where we get to observe and personally experience a preserved space that was so intimate to the lives of the people they are based on.

Where We Live is dedicated to exhibiting the intimate and evolving story of the home. Through meticulously recreated spaces, we offer our visitors a journey into the rooms that have shaped various artists. Our mission is to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for the diversity of domestic life, highlighting the universal aspects of home, while honoring the specific details that make each living space unique. We aim to inspire a sense of shared humanity and a recognition of the home not just as a physical space, but as a reflection of personal identity, cultural values, and historical change. Where We Live provides a vibrant community space that encourages curiosity, empathy, and an appreciation for the formative walls that have shaped who we are.
